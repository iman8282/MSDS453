IKL_Doc1_PiratesOfTheCaribbean:TheCurseOfTheBlackPearl,"There's a nice little 90-minute B movie trapped inside the 143 minutes of ""Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl,"" a movie that charms the audience and then outstays its welcome. Although the ending leaves open the possibility of a sequel, the movie feels like it already includes the sequel; maybe that explains the double-barreled title. It's a good thing that Geoffrey Rush and Johnny Depp are on hand to jack up the acting department. Their characters, two world-class goofballs, keep us interested even during entirely pointless swordfights.
Pointless? See if you can follow me here. Capt. Jack Sparrow (Depp) has a deep hatred for Capt. Barbossa (Rush), who led a mutiny aboard Sparrow's pirate ship, the Black Pearl, and left Capt. Jack stranded on a deserted island. Barbossa and his crew then ran afoul of an ancient curse that turned them into the Undead. By day they look like normal if dissolute humans, but by the light of the moon, they're revealed as skeletal cadavers. Now here's the important part: Because they're already dead, they cannot be killed. Excuse me for supplying logic where it is manifestly not wanted, but doesn't that mean there's no point in fighting them? There's a violent battle at one point between the Black Pearl crew and sailors of the Royal Navy, and unless I am mistaken the sailors would all eventually have to be dead because the skeletons could just keep on fighting forever, until they won. Yes? The only reason I bring this up is that the battle scenes actually feel as if they go on forever. It's fun at first to see a pirate swordfight, but eventually it gets to the point where the sword-clashing, yardarm-swinging and timber-shivering get repetitious. I also lost count of how many times Jack Sparrow is the helpless captive of both the British and the pirates, and escapes from the chains/brig/noose/island.
And yet the movie made me grin at times, and savor the daffy plot, and enjoy the way Depp and Rush fearlessly provide performances that seem nourished by deep wells of nuttiness. Depp in particular seems to be channeling a drunken drag queen, with his eyeliner and the way he minces ashore and slurs his dialogue ever so insouciantly. Don't mistake me: This is not a criticism, but admiration for his work. It can be said that his performance is original in its every atom. There has never been a pirate, or for that matter a human being, like this in any other movie. There's some talk about how he got too much sun while he was stranded on that island, but his behavior shows a lifetime of rehearsal. He is a peacock in full display.
Consider how boring it would have been if Depp had played the role straight, as an Errol Flynn or Douglas Fairbanks (Sr. or Jr.) might have. To take this material seriously would make it unbearable. Capt. Sparrow's behavior is so rococo that other members of the cast actually comment on it. And yet because it is consistent and because you can never catch Depp making fun of the character, it rises to a kind of cockamamie sincerity.
Geoffrey Rush is relatively subdued--but only by contrast. His Barbossa, whose teeth alone would intimidate a congregation of dentists, brings gnashing to an art form.",
IKL_Doc1_PiratesOfTheCaribbean:TheCurseOfTheBlackPearl,"Jack Sparrow is one very strange pirate, and thank heaven for that. As Johnny Depp plays him, with Cockney accent, kohl-blackened eyes and a prancing brio that wouldn't be out of place in a Christopher Street parade, he's by far the best reason to see ""Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl."" Depp gave us a glimpse of his comic finesse in the 1995 ""Don Juan DeMarco,"" and here--in a Jerry Bruckheimer-produced high-seas adventure that incorporates roaring cannons, oddball comedy, a love story and more than a touch of the supernatural--Depp unleashes his theatrical bravado. He's hilarious.
Sparrow teams up with blacksmith Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) to rescue the beautiful daughter (Keira Knightley) of the governor of Port Royal. She's been kidnapped by Sparrow's pirate nemesis, Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush), who thinks she can dispel an ancient curse that has turned him and his greedy, grimy crew into the undead. And so on. ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" has its ups and downs, but it's better than a movie based on a theme-park ride has any right to be. The screenplay, by Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio, tends to work best in its comic mode. After a while, the sea battles begin to feel redundant. Director Gore Verbinski's fight scenes between the good guys and the ghostly pirate warriors suffer from the same problem that afflicted ""The Matrix Reloaded"": how can you generate life-or-death suspense with characters who can't die? Fortunately, whenever the movie starts to sag, Depp flies to the rescue. It's a truly piratical performance: with his flamboyantly fluttering fingers he steals every scene in the movie. This comedy is well integrated into the story, helping us to get to know the characters and the relationships that arise between them, but always with the mind of offering the viewer pure popcorn entertainment of the first level. Only the film's PG-13 rating prevents him from doing unthinkable things to the heroine, Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley), whose blood, it is thought, can free the captain and his crew from the Curse of the Black Pearl.
Elizabeth is the daughter of Weatherby Swann, the governor (Jonathan Pryce) of Port Royal, a British base in the Caribbean, and seems destined to marry Cmdr. Norrington (Jack Davenport), a fate which we intuit would lead to a lifetime of conversations about his constipation.
She truly loves the handsome young swordsmith Will Turner (Orlando Bloom), whom she met when they were both children, after spotting him adrift on a raft with a golden pirate medallion around his neck, which turns out to hold the key to the curse. Jack Sparrow takes a fatherly interest in young Turner, especially when he discovers who his father was ... and that is quite enough of the plot.
Bloom is well cast in a severely limited role as the heroic straight-arrow. He has the classic profile of a silent-film star. Knightley you will recall as the best friend of the heroine in ""Bend It Like Beckham,"" where she had a sparkle altogether lacking here.
Truth be told, she doesn't generate enough fire to explain why these swashbucklers would risk their lives for her, and in closeup, seems composed when she should smolder. Parminder K. Nagra, the star of ""Beckham,"" might have been a more spirited choice.
""Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl"" is ""based on"" the theme park ride at Disney World, which I have taken many times. It is also inspired (as the ride no doubt was) by the rich tradition of pirate movies, and excels in such departments as buried treasure, pirates' caves, pet parrots and walking the plank, although there is a shortage of eye patches and hooks.",
IKL_Doc1_PiratesOfTheCaribbean:TheCurseOfTheBlackPearl,"If there was a minor quibble with the movie, it is that it is a little overlong. Putting that aside, this is a truly wonderful film, that is definitely one of the highlights of 2003. The whole film is a wonder to look at, with splendid costumes and very realistic sets. The script is just a gem, with classic and original lines like ""Stop blowing holes in my ship,"" that sometimes have you in gales of laughter. I did find the pirates as skeletons quite frightening though. Films that have scared me are The Mummy and Pitch Black. The performances were first-rate, especially Johnny Depp in possibly his best performance. His character Jack Sparrow is a somewhat charming, likable rogue, and Depp pulled him off to perfection. As Barbossa, Geoffrey Rush positively sinks his teeth into his role, sometimes sinister and sometimes fun. Kiera Knightly proves once again that she looks lovely in period dramas, because it really does suit her. Orlando Bloom is dashing as Will Turner. Before I round off, I want to mention another aspect of the film, the music by Hans Zimmer(Lion King)... it was outstanding! Zimmer should be up there with the great film composers, like James Horner(American Tail, Titanic), John Williams(ET, Home Alone) and the late Jerry Goldsmith.(Legend, The Shadow) All in all, a highly entertaining film! 10/10 Bethany Cox.
This first of the Pirates Of The Caribbean series, Curse Of The Black Pearl was a milestone in the career of star Johnny Depp. I always liked Depp since 21 Jump Street and he always chose quirky products where he did great as an actor, but the films were more often than not less than successful commercially. With this film first and foremost Depp got himself linked to a commercial success that spawned several sequels. His box office was now secure.
But also this is a once in a lifetime chance to do a part that calls for some of the most outrageous overacting you'll ever see. I think Johnny Depp might have been channeling Robert Newton in one of his pirate films, be it Blackbeard or Treasure Island.
In fact the plot is a lot like Treasure Island in the sense that Depp is looking to get back his ship the Black Pearl. It was taken over by his former First Mate Barboso played by Geoffrey Rush and the whole crew Depp included is under a really bad curse. A couple of civilians, governor's daughter Keira Knightley and blacksmith Orlando Bloom are also part of the adventure.
The Pirates Of The Caribbean blends both the swashbuckling adventure film and the horror genre quite nicely. I can certainly Robert Newton in the part had this been 60-70 years ago. 
This is one film as are the rest in the series to just kick back and enjoy.
Governor Weatherby Swann (Jonathan Pryce), his daughter Elizabeth and Lieutenant James Norrington (Jack Davenport) rescue boy Will Turner from a burning wreck on their way to Port Royal. Elizabeth hides Will's gold pirate medallion. Eight years later, Governor Swann is trying to set up Elizabeth (Keira Knightley) with the fast rising Norrington but she is still taken with Will (Orlando Bloom), now a swordsmith. Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) rescues Elizabeth from the water but he is set to hang for being a pirate. He escapes but Will helps catch him. Meanwhile the gold pirate medallion has called in Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) on the haunted Black Pearl to attack the port. Barbossa kidnaps Elizabeth with the medallion. Will frees Sparrow to pursue her.
The movie is bombastic, chaotic and messy. It's great to have Knightley and Bloom but it is Johnny Depp who steals the film. It is such a crazy performance that it is bigger than everything else. Without it, this movie would be a messy muddled thing. With it, this is a wonderful brilliant exuberant fun mess. In a film overstuffed with CGI, big sets and wild characters, Depp has a neon sign flashing over him in one of the most original performance ever in movie history.",
IKL_Doc1_PiratesOfTheCaribbean:TheCurseOfTheBlackPearl,"Really good fun  doesn't take itself too seriously and is played to perfection by a wonderful Depp
bob the moo1 September 2003
Sailing with her father as a girl, Elizabeth Swann, is on board when the military ship comes across a wreck from which they rescue only a young boy, Will Turner. Elizabeth hides the boy's medallion in order to hide the fact that he is a pirate, she also thinks she sees the mysterious ship The Black Pearl. Years later Elizabeth is being wooed by officers while Will is a blacksmith in her father's service. When her medallion calls out to another force, it brings the crew of the Pearl to the bay in search of the gold. Elizabeth is kidnapped and Will resolves to go after her. He turns to the only man he knows who knows the black pearl  incarcerated pirate Captain Jack Sparrow. However how can you trust a pirate's word?
I'll be honest and say that I didn't want to see this film  I had been totally turned off by the trailer. The one attempt at humour in the trailer is that awful `try wearing a corset' line, it didn't get a laugh in the film or on the trailer. However I did go and see it and, after Hulk and Matrix, I was very glad I did. The plot is pretty enjoyable allowing for lots of fights but also enough twists and turns to hold the interest. It doesn't all make total sense but, like the ride it is based on, the film moves on before you have time to think too hard about anything.
Unlike those other blockbusters I mentioned, POTC doesn't take itself too seriously. It doesn't make fun of itself either, but it does have it's tongue in it's cheek the whole time. This is seen in the vein of gentle humour that runs through it in the dialogue, action and characters  the film is basically having fun so it is easy for the audience to get with it too.
As every other reviewer on earth has said, the biggest strength of the film is Depp's Captain Jack. Playing him like a drugged out rock star who clings to his half-fame like a life raft, Depp wrings so much humour out of every line, every scene and every little thing he does (`but why is the rum on fire?' being my favourite line). It is a performance that could have been awful but he pitches it just perfectly and stops the film ever becoming anything less than fun. The only downside of his character (who makes his appearance on a ship revealed to be a tiny, sinking boat) is that the film sags a little when he is off screen for longer than 5 minutes.
Bloom and Knightly carry the film's more serious core and thus have a less glorious job. Both do well however and are good if not quite stars  certainly I was surprised to see Knightly with such a big role in a big film. Rush enjoys himself as Barbossa and the crew also have fun. The effects are used just as they should always be used  to compliment the film rather than be the raison d'etre! The effects are good without replacing plot or characters  they are well blended into the flow so never bring the film to a halt by their use (although wine flowing through and out of Barbossa is pretty impressive).
Overall I enjoyed this film a great deal. Sure it is not a classic film or a perfect one, but it does exactly what a summer film should be  entertain. It doesn't take itself too seriously and moves a long at a fair pace without ever lapsing into impatient editing or flashy visuals. Having said that, if Depp was not onboard the film would be much the lesser. His exaggerated performance enhances the tongue in cheek feel to the film and makes it a much funnier, livelier and all round fun experience.",
IKL_Doc1_PiratesOfTheCaribbean:TheCurseOfTheBlackPearl,"And he has a great entrance. A really great one, if you haven't seen it yet, go watch it! Even if it's only the first scene with Johnny Depp as Cpt. Jack Sparrow! While many/some have dismissed Johnnys performance here as being gay, I do think his intentions were others! That's not only because he himself said so in an interview (his inspiration being Keith Richards as he said), but also because I saw him as crazy, but genius guy, who was different.
But kudos have also to go out to Gore Verbinsky. First of all, for resurrecting the pirate movie ""genre"" (maybe genre is not the right word, but you get what I mean) and also for sticking to Johnnys decision to play Sparrow the way he did! It's know that the studio didn't want Johnny to play it like that. They were afraid, that Johnny's performance would destroy it at the box office ... quite the opposite happened! Captain Jack Sparrow is the one who saved this thing from drowning (excuse the pun)! If you haven't watched it yet, go out and see it now! A great adventure with a crazy/great guy in the middle of it!
Yo ho ho and a bottle of rum! That's what I feel like having watched ""Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl""! I have to admit that I don't know any other pirate movies, but this one gives the genre the best possible name. It's mainly due to Johnny Depp's ultra-neat role as swashbuckler Jack Sparrow, but there's other things too.
It all begins when a little girl retrieves a medallion from a boy; she doesn't realize just how important this particular medallion is! Several years later, we see that this now grown-up girl is Elizabeth Swann (the ever gorgeous Keira Knightley), the governor's daughter. Unfortunately, that's when the pirates led by Capt. Hector Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) storm the town and take Elizabeth hostage.
Enter Jack Sparrow and his brave companion Will Turner (Orlando Bloom). These guys may be oddballs, but boy do they know how to fight pirates! Depp based his characterization on Keith Richards (yes, THE Keith Richards), and he plays the role to great effect. ""POTC: TCOTBP"" is a real treat from beginning to end. Gore Verbinski is proving himself to be a very interesting director, with this movie - plus ""Mouse Hunt"" and ""The Ring"" - to his credit. Now that I've seen this movie, I almost might like to try out a little swashbuckling myself. A pirate's life just might be the life for me...
Blacksmith Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) teams up with eccentric pirate ""Captain"" Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) to save his love, the governor's daughter, from Jack's former pirate allies, who are now undead.
Although he has been around since the early 1980s, and has made such great films as ""Edward Scissorhands"", this is now the role Depp is best known for. And, as of now (2015) it may remain that way, as his career seems to be in idle any time he appears as any other role (though his Wolf in ""Into the Woods"" has its charms).
Worth pointing out is how this film has one of the finest scores ever recorded for a Hollywood movie. Even if the soundtrack existed and the screen was blank, the film would deserve credit just for the score. Not many films could claim this, but ""Pirates"" can.",
IKL_Doc1_PiratesOfTheCaribbean:TheCurseOfTheBlackPearl,"Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl in My opinion is not one of the greatest movies of all time. Sure, it has a huge budget, a different cast (which included Johnny Depp, Geoffrey Rush, Orlando Bloom, Keira Knightley, and Jonathan Pryce!), great special effects, and a lengthy two hour plus run time but this film never did anything for Me and here are the reasons why it didn't.
The following is in My opinion.
1. Johnny Depp is a good actor but I just didn't know what to think of his character whether I should like him, hate him, or feel sorry for him.
2. I'm an action movie nut and there was a lot of action but the action just wasn't exciting enough that its so great it'll be one of the films I'll see over and over. In other words nothing special or spectacular happened in this one.
3. The music by up coming composer Klaus Badelt was ok but most of it was just recycled of Hans Zimmer's one of a kind score from the greatest epic called Gladiator (2000)! Badelt composed an excellent score for the Time Machine and retooled the music and this is what we get for this? Why?
4. Some of the things that happened in the film was supposed to be funny but I didn't think it was and I didn't think the comedy stuff was needed.
5. The late great Trevor Goddard had a brief role in this movie and I believe it was his last one. Why give an actor with an incredible muscular build, a unique accent, and amazing talent a scene where it makes him look like a complete joke?
You may be thinking why I am saying this. How can I say this about a movie that is so high in fame and stature? I am just saying how I feel about the film. The film had all the potential and everything going for it but it just didn't do it. I wanted to like the movie but it never changed. I don't agree about it being on the IMDb's Top 250: #235! In fact, I think it shouldn't even be on the list. There are many other films that deserve to be on the list more than this film! You mean to tell Me that this is on the same list with The Lord of the Rings Trilogy? Plus there are many more movies with much more excitement similar to this movie like the Planet of the Apes (2001), The Mummy, and The Mummy Returns, and Cutthroat Island! In My opinion Pirates of the Caribbean's competion The Hulk and Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines was so much better and exciting in My opinion! Anyway I feel if you wanted to watch a much more epic pirate movie instead see Cutthroat Island, its much more exciting! I hate to say this but Pirates of the Caribbean is awfully dull, boring, uninteresting, uninspiring, it has no depth, and it should be avoided like a flood!",
IKL_Doc1_PiratesOfTheCaribbean:TheCurseOfTheBlackPearl,"Well, I have to say, this movie was such an exciting experience!!!!! I rented this one stormy night on DVD and boy, this movie was so exciting!!!!! This movie, of course, is based on the theme park ride at Disneyland and Disney World. I liked all the action and stuff in there; it was awesome!!!!! I especially liked the bonus features, too: there were the bloopers (""Is that a plane?????"" - Johnny Depp heard a small jet rocket by the ship), and of course, the excerpt from ""Walt Disney Presents,"" which I actually remembered seeing on the old Disney Channel one night in 1998.
Buuuuuut, there is a problem. (OH NO!!!!! is right!!!!!)
This is a ""BAD PERIOD"" movie!!!!! That's right, for one, this movie totally changed the way we go to the parks now!!!!! The ride was changed to make it look like the movie now, and even worse, there are rumors that the Tom Sawyer ride at Disneyland will go away with - get this - a new ride based on this film!!!!! Plus, the worst part????? IT'S RATED PG-13!!!!! Yes, you heard right!!!!! A ""Disney"" movie, given such a controversial rating so that families can't see this or any other movie in this series because it's too scary!!!!! So basically, Disney now robs of its usual audience in the ""Bad Period.""
""PIRATE DVDS OF THE EAST: THE CURSE OF THE MPAA'S FOCUS"" is a film that, while it appeals to us adults, JUST DOES NOT APPEAL TO CHILDREN!!!!! Bad idea! -1000000/10 for making a grown company cry!!!!!
Naturally, computer graphics had to get in there --- pirates alone could never be enough for the modern child. She has to have pirates who are ghouls as well, so that the film is a messy hybrid of horror and adventure.
The combination of men who can't be killed fighting endlessly with characters made of wood while a symphony orchestra goes crazy is utterly tedious.
It's so sad that worldwide youngsters subject to the American global market have only this junk-food to consume on DVD.
Throughout the whole deadening two and a half hours, there are about five seconds of shots of the Caribbean. The picture might as well have been shot in Disneyland.
Johnny Depp is even more pathetic here than in his next role, The Libertine, in which he played a sex-crazed poet who never touches a woman throughout the whole film.
His British accent, predictably, is a mess (as in The Libertine) and his role in this film is to spend long periods in a cell while everyone else gets on with it. The idea that he is some kind of commander of men is ridiculous. He simply camps up the whole picture and makes a mockery of it.
Naturally, the plot is the most ludicrous imaginable, it's not even worth discussing. Suffice it to say that it is full of holes you could navigate a ship through.
As for black people who populate the Caribbean, just two appear in this picture: one a glimpsed female pirate captain (!), the other a glimpsed huge stereotyped brute with a studded face and massive muscles. So, take your pick: cheesy stereotype or politically correct cut-out. As for the other millions who inhabit the Caribbean, they don't exist.
If there was a scrap of history that validated this film as a nostalgic romp, it might be excusable. But since it is a farrago of fantasy and faux-fairytale, it is to be roundly condemned. Everyone who raves about this film is doomed.",
IKL_Doc1_PiratesOfTheCaribbean:TheCurseOfTheBlackPearl,"I can not remember the last time I saw a Disney film that was as bad as this is. Why do people who have had no acting lessons and are not fully trained actors continually get acting work at the expense of those that have been fully trained and therefore can act? Johnny Depp is proof of point of someone who has absolutely no ability to act whatsoever due to having had no lessons in how to act and is the complete opposite of fully trained and yet he keeps getting work in front of someone who is fully trained! The rest of the cast did rather well with the dreadful script, the storyline was almost non-existent, and didn't do anything remotely new. If half of The scenes where buckles were swashed and cut the rest shorter there still would have been far more than enough swash buckling to suit everyone that went to see the film. At over two hours long half an hour could have been taken out and it still would have been far too long! Johnny Depp's English accent was....well....let's just say it was obvious that it was an American trying to speak in and with an English accent, unlike Kevin Costner when he did Robin Hood Prince Of Thieves! 
There was ABSOLUTELY NOTHING good about this generic pirate film. It had two story lines in it both of them having been told and shown countless times in far better ways numerous times before I wouldn't be at all surprised. OK so I Told a lie when I said there was absolutely nothing good about the film, as there was on thing good about it, the closing/end credits! Once they come on it means, thankfully, this extremely boring, exceedingly tedious film that has been stre-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-tched to as long as it can be can now be switched off!
Is this a story that inspires, captivates and entrances? That's what it's creators think it is. And far too many gullible viewers think that this is art.
But what is great about it? A little bit of swashbuckling action to begin with, and nothing new. Then the whole pursuit, cove, cave thing. Not only was the storyline descending into the abyss but so was the film. Really, what was all that cave foolishness worth? Not my time.
With the talent and the budget sunk into this project, 3/4 of the directors alive today with a good writer in tow could have made this into a movie!
The old pirate movies put this one to shame. The main couple is so dislikable with babbling honorably sounding dialogue but without showing one shred of goodness that you expect in a pirate movie. This is also reflected in the script, which makes them act as if with good intentions, but when you reflect, only to make them look good. Naturally the end is incredibly cheesy, events without motivation, impossible action, and quite good special effects and big breasts to keep the eye interested.",
IKL_Doc1_PiratesOfTheCaribbean:TheCurseOfTheBlackPearl,"The Pirates of the Caribbean the curse of the black pearl, is a very good film. Everything in this film is quite outstanding, but lets face it, people are starting to get over obsessed with this film and calling it ""The best"". I don't think it deserves to be in the TOP 250, and in a better number than IN America, Henry the Va and 21 Grams. Johnny Depp's performance is very good, funny and realistic, however, it didn't deserved an Oscar nomination. The OSCARS should pick the best performances for the nomination, but Johnny's performance was not that great. Great visuals, a nice interesting story, good performances, good make up, but it is still and will be another blockbuster film. 7.56/100
Disclaimer: I saw a moderately crappy cam-version with a crappy dub (50% translation, 50% own creation).
Most people seem to enjoy this flick and I guess that chances are that you will too. I saw it (better to say some parts of it) yesterday and to say I was disappointed is to say nothing. After about one hour my dad said he can't bear it anymore and walked out. I followed him, but later returned, since I had to kill time somehow. My mother and 19 y.o. sister moderately enjoyed it (or may be just thought it would get better), but after less than two hours said they will watch it sometime later (read 'never') and stopped it.
Well, my impression was that the movie was pretty stupid and cliche. May be not the worst script, but nothing to write home about. The acting was either over the top (Johnny Depp) or bland and boring (everyone else). There might have been some brilliant special effects that I missed on the cam-copy, but I doubt it. There was hardly any sea worth looking at, and everything else was taken out of the Hollywood library of generic effects.
If you have nothing better to do, see it on the big screen, may be it will look cool (it probably won't). Don't pay much for the tickets, though.
this movie sucks , its way too long kind of boring and a very crappy ending. the only thing that saved this movie was johnny depp . the only reason this movie made alot of money is because it was a ride at disneyland . WOW , that is so exciting , actually no it isnt this movie is the worst film i have seen ever , god i want that 2 and a half hours of my life back , and my 8 dollars , well all i have is 4 words: i hate this movie
Terrible, repelling and completely unwatchable. It makes the first Mummy look like a masterpiece. Even the visual effects are terrible and ugly to look at. And Johnny Depp's performance was bad in every way. Just because you manage to speak in a way that is hard to understand does not mean it is good acting. What was the Academy thinking have they completely lost their mind. As much as I thought Return of the King was ridiculously overrated after this abomination I am starting to respect it. After such a bad decade of bad and unoriginal movies people must have broken critical fuse and mistaken this atrocity for a great movie. When will James Cameron finally start making movies and resurrect Cinema. A very deserving 1 out of 10.",
IKL_Doc1_PiratesOfTheCaribbean:TheCurseOfTheBlackPearl,"This movie was absolutely horrible. I want that 2 hours of my life back. It is extremely predictable and written by a formula. Depp did his usual strong performance, but I wonder if he actually read the script before agreeing to do the movie. My guess is that he was looking for a money maker and the Disney logo spelled cash. It must be expensive living in France. Even though Depp performed well, the persistent intentional head bobbing was annoying. It could have been understandable if there was anything resembling a story.
How sad. I was so looking forward to this movie. I love Pirate Lore. From the director of that smash hit The Mexican, this movie sucked. It should have gotten more Disney treatment, or none at all. The story was so shallow, the characters were so shallow, that it would have maybe been a terribly entertaining film for the kids, but the movie was too dark and violent for the little ones. I thought Depp would work wonders with this, but the script was so inane. There wasn't enough meat for the adults. I didn't care at all about any of the characters. I kept wating to hear ""Ding, please turn the page."" 
Some nice moments, but just a few. Over all, a let down. Rent the Musketeer for swordplay, or rent Mutiny for munity. As for pirates, even the Pirate Movie starring Kristie McNichol was more engaging than this. And it was a musical.
There has been so much hype about this film, but in reality (well, in my opinion anyway) it is seriously bad. Let me explain myself...
Firstly, Johnny Depp, who everyone thinks has given some career-defining performance, simply hops around dressed as a woman and makes cliched little comments that really grate. Secondly, Depp and Bloom's swordfight near the beginning of the film is horrifically dull. They spend the first few minutes exchanging limp jibes (physical and verbal) walking indifferently around the set... one is left half-asleep. I know the action comes later, but this dull, empty screen-time is unusual for Disney. But the most laughable element of the film (so far) is this absolutely ridiculous idea that between the ragtag, thieving bunch that pirates were, there existed a 'code of honour'. We see in the film one of the characters asking not to be killed because, according to 'the code', she has the right to 'Parley' and can be saved from death and have a nice chat with the captain instead. When the captain later tries to distance himself from this and says that the code is 'less rules...more a set of guidelines' I was crying into my chips. This is Final Destination-quality craziness.
Anyway...just thought you should all know this film really ain't that great.
im pretty surprised that this is actually on the top 250 list, and ahead of some pretty impressive films.
I was dissapointed to say the least, when putting the disc in the dvd i thought to myself ""a good ol fashioned, pirate ghost tale, marvelous"".... ah no... suffice to say the peak was when i got a chuckle out of the scene where you see Depp standing tall and proud as he jumps down on what you expect to be a massive ship but turns out to be a dinky sailboat. That was about 5 minutes into the movie, it all went down from there. It was just boring to me, pirates who were cursed and now need the blood of a certain fellow to lift it, whoooo. Orlando Bloom was annoying, I can understand pre teenage girls waving their ""Potc"" flags because hes oh so hot(those would be the imdb users with reviews like, ""omigawd this is like tha best movie EVER, orlando bloom rules!!!111"".
My confirmation came when my sweet mother, who never has a bad word to say about anyone or anything proclaimed, ""it wasnt really good"", when an hour rolled around we had both lost all interest and i was reading comic books, glancing at the tv now and then to see if anything interesting pops up. It didnt. Finally, I fell asleep.",,,
